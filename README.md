An investigation into wildfires in California in 2020.

This report is an investigation into the wildfire siege that occurred in the state of California, USA in August 2020. This report has two main aims. Firstly, to quantify the extent to which this time period saw a higher incidence and/or larger area of wildfires than previous years, and secondly to investigate any possible correlation between fires in this time period and other environmental factors, such as air temperature, wind speed, and lightning strikes. Hopefully this project will shed some light on the events in California in August 2020 and help to provide an understanding of why they occurred. NASA Thermal Anomalies and Fire data is used to detect fire events. This data is analysed numerically in Python to calculate total fire area, total number of distinct fires, how long individual fires burn for, and how the fires interact with each other. This data is also displayed graphically to show how the wildfires overlap with areas that experienced higher than average temperatures, little or no precipitation, and high numbers of lightning strikes. This report shows that 2020 was a year of extremes. California experienced record breaking temperatures, a highly concentrated surge of lightning strikes, and huge wildfires. All of these emphasise the urgent need for governments and individuals to implement measures to protect the climate.
